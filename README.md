# Whatsapp-bot
Welcome to the "Whatsapp-bot using Python" repository! 
This project is a collaborative effort by a team of two passionate developers, and it serves as their 1st-year engineering project.
The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive WhatsApp bot, leveraging Python and integrating it with the Twilio Sandbox API.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up a Twilio account and get the necessary credentials.
4. Update the configuration in the `config.py` file with your Twilio credentials.
5. Download and set up [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel to your local development environment. This will enable Twilio to communicate with your WhatsApp bot running locally.
6. Run the bot using: `python app.py`.2
